siddmp still writes its outpout to stdout, additionaly it creates:

<sidfile>.dmp - a binary sid dump of the first 25 bytes at $d400, each frame

<sidfile>.h   - an ascii readable C header file of the binary dmp ready to 
                include

These files can be used for playback on microcontrollers with or without 
SD-card usage (stream .dmp file or include .h file to play from memory),
or by any siddmp utility for further investigation.

Especially useful to debug hardrestart usage and instrument timings.
